- Prepare ( to find and collect the data you'll need to answer the questions )
- Process ( to clean and organize the data - removing inconsistencies, filling in missing values, changing the data to a format that's easier to work with )
- Analyze ( analyzing the data to uncover answers and solutions )
- Share ( sharing the report to decision-makers through a report, presentation, or data visualizations )
- Act ( implementing changes and taking actions )

**Data ecosystems** - the various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data.
**Cloud** - a place to keep data online, rather than a computer hard drive.
