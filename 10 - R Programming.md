```
print("Coding in R")

# Here's an example of a comment
first_variable <- "This is my variable"
second_variable <- 12.5

# This is an example of a vector
vec_1 <- c(13, 48.5, 71, 101.2, 5, 78)
vec_1 # This gives the output 13 48.5 71 101.2 5 78

**vector** -- is a group of data elements of the same type, stored in a one-dimensional sequence. Vectors can only contain data of one type

**Lists** -- are different from atomic vectors because their elements can be of any type—including characters, integers, and logical values. Lists can even contain other lists, matrices, vectors, or data frames
