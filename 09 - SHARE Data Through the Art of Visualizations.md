Information - data with which you're working 
Story - a clear and compelling narrative or concept
Goal - a specific objective or function for the visual
Visual form - an effective use of metaphor or visual expression

Connect data with images:
- Bar graphs (use size contrast to compare two or more values)
- Line graphs (helps understand shifts or changes in your data)
- Pie charts (show how much each part of something makes up the whole)
- Maps (help organize data geographically)
- Histogram (a chart that shows how often data values fall into certain ranges)
- Heatmaps (use color to compare categories in a data set)
- Scatterplot (show relationship between different variables)

## Your evaluation criteria

When exploring a slide presentation, use your knowledge of effective presentation practices to evaluate it. This includes reviewing your own work! When you’re checking over slide presentations, there are some best practices you can check for:
- **Include a title, subtitle, and date:** Making sure that your slide deck presentation has a title, subtitle, and date makes sure that your audience knows exactly what you are presenting and when the information was from. That way they know it’s relevant and current to them!
- **Use a logical sequence of slides:** Organizing your slides in an order that makes sense guides your audience through your narrative, building understanding step by step.
- **Provide an agenda with a timeline:** An agenda offers a roadmap of your presentation, allowing your audience to follow along and anticipate key topics.
- **Limit the amount of text on slides:** Keeping text brief ensures clarity and retains the audience’s attention; aim for your audience to scan it within 5 seconds.
- **Start with the business task:** By immediately relating the content to the business task at hand, you contextualize your information, making it relevant and actionable.
- **Establish the initial hypothesis:** Presenting an initial hypothesis gives your audience a starting point for what to expect and frames the subsequent analysis.
- **Show what business metrics you used:** Clarifying which metrics you're analyzing validates your arguments and helps the audience gauge your presentation's relevance to business outcomes.
- **Use visualizations:** Visual aids can illustrate complex data more effectively than text alone, making your message more accessible.
- **Introduce the graphic by name:** A brief introduction to each graphic aids in understanding and retaining information.
- **Provide a title for each graph:** Titles act as signposts, helping the audience quickly grasp the meaning of each visual.
- **Go from the general to the specific:** Starting with a broad overview before diving into details ensures that all audience members are on the same page.
- **Use speaker notes to help you remember talking points:** Notes act as your cue cards, enabling a smoother delivery and ensuring no critical point is missed.
- **Include key takeaways:** Summarizing the main points at the end of your presentation reinforces the message and ensures the audience leaves with the intended takeaways.

Messy presentation: people don’t know where to focus their attention -- 
The main problem with the messy presentation is the lack of a logical flow. Notice also how the data visualizations are hard to understand and appear without any introduction or explanation. The audience has no sense of what they are looking at and why.  When people in the audience have to figure out what the data means without any help, they can end up being lost, confused, and unclear about any actions they need to take.

Good presentation: people are logically guided through the data --
The good presentation logically guides the audience through the data – from the objectives at the beginning all the way to the conclusions at the end. Notice how the data visualizations are introduced using a common theme and are thoughtfully placed before each conclusion. A good presentation gives people in the audience the facts and data, helps them understand what the data means, and provides takeaways about how they can use their understanding to make a change or do some good.
