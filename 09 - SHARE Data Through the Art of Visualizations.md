Information - data with which you're working 
Story - a clear and compelling narrative or concept
Goal - a specific objective or function for the visual
Visual form - an effective use of metaphor or visual expression

Connect data with images:
- Bar graphs (use size contrast to compare two or more values)
- Line graphs (helps understand shifts or changes in your data)
- Pie charts (show how much each part of something makes up the whole)
- Maps (help organize data geographically)
- Histogram (a chart that shows how often data values fall into certain ranges)
- Heatmaps (use color to compare categories in a data set)
- Scatterplot (show relationship between different variables)

## Your evaluation criteria

When exploring a slide presentation, use your knowledge of effective presentation practices to evaluate it. This includes reviewing your own work! When you’re checking over slide presentations, there are some best practices you can check for:
- **Include a title, subtitle, and date:** Making sure that your slide deck presentation has a title, subtitle, and date makes sure that your audience knows exactly what you are presenting and when the information was from. That way they know it’s relevant and current to them!
- **Use a logical sequence of slides:** Organizing your slides in an order that makes sense guides your audience through your narrative, building understanding step by step.
- **Provide an agenda with a timeline:** An agenda offers a roadmap of your presentation, allowing your audience to follow along and anticipate key topics.
- **Limit the amount of text on slides:** Keeping text brief ensures clarity and retains the audience’s attention; aim for your audience to scan it within 5 seconds.
- **Start with the business task:** By immediately relating the content to the business task at hand, you contextualize your information, making it relevant and actionable.
- **Establish the initial hypothesis:** Presenting an initial hypothesis gives your audience a starting point for what to expect and frames the subsequent analysis.
- **Show what business metrics you used:** Clarifying which metrics you're analyzing validates your arguments and helps the audience gauge your presentation's relevance to business outcomes.
- **Use visualizations:** Visual aids can illustrate complex data more effectively than text alone, making your message more accessible.
- **Introduce the graphic by name:** A brief introduction to each graphic aids in understanding and retaining information.
- **Provide a title for each graph:** Titles act as signposts, helping the audience quickly grasp the meaning of each visual.
- **Go from the general to the specific:** Starting with a broad overview before diving into details ensures that all audience members are on the same page.
- **Use speaker notes to help you remember talking points:** Notes act as your cue cards, enabling a smoother delivery and ensuring no critical point is missed.
- **Include key takeaways:** Summarizing the main points at the end of your presentation reinforces the message and ensures the audience leaves with the intended takeaways.

**Share data findings in presentations:** 
Messy presentation: people don’t know where to focus their attention -- 
The main problem with the messy presentation is the lack of a logical flow. Notice also how the data visualizations are hard to understand and appear without any introduction or explanation. The audience has no sense of what they are looking at and why.  When people in the audience have to figure out what the data means without any help, they can end up being lost, confused, and unclear about any actions they need to take.

Good presentation: people are logically guided through the data --
The good presentation logically guides the audience through the data – from the objectives at the beginning all the way to the conclusions at the end. Notice how the data visualizations are introduced using a common theme and are thoughtfully placed before each conclusion. A good presentation gives people in the audience the facts and data, helps them understand what the data means, and provides takeaways about how they can use their understanding to make a change or do some good.

First slide: Agenda --
Provide a high-level bulleted list of the topics you will cover and the amount of time you will spend on each. Every company’s norms are different, but in general, most presentations run from 30 minutes to an hour at most. Here is an example of a 30-minute agenda:
- Introductions (4 minutes)
- Project overview and goals (5 minutes)
- Data and analysis (10 minutes)
- Recommendations (3 minutes)
- Actionable steps (3 minutes)
- Questions (5 minutes)

Second slide: Purpose --
Everyone might not be familiar with your project or know why it is important. They didn’t spend the last couple of weeks thinking about the analysis and results of your project like you did. This slide summarizes the purpose of the project and why it is important to the business for your audience.
Here is an example of a purpose statement:
_Service center consolidation is an important cost savings initiative. The aim of this project was to determine the impact of service center consolidation on customer response times._ 

Third slide: Data/analysis --
First, It really is possible to tell your data story in a single slide if you summarize the key things about your data and analysis. You may have supporting slides with additional data or information in an appendix at the end of the presentation. 
But, if you choose to tell your story using more than one slide, keep the following in mind:
- Slides typically have a logical order (beginning, middle, and end) to fully build the story. 
- Each slide should logically introduce the slide that follows it. Visual cues from the slides or verbal cues from your talking points should let the audience know when you will go on to the next slide. 
- Remember not to use too much text on the slides. When in doubt, refer back to the second tip on preparing talking points and limiting the text on slides. 
- The high-level information that people read from the slides shouldn’t be the same as the information you provide in your talking points. There should be a nice balance between the two to tell a good story. You don’t want to simply read or say the words on the slides.

For extra visuals on the slides, use animations. For example, you can:
- Fade in one bullet point at a time as you discuss each on a slide.
- Only display the visual that is relevant to what you are talking about (fade out non-relevant visuals).
- Use arrows or callouts to point to a specific area of a visual that you are using.

Fourth slide: Recommendations --
If you have been telling your story well in the previous slides, the recommendations will be obvious to your audience. This is when you might get a lot of questions about how your data supports your recommendations. Be ready to communicate how your data backs up your conclusion or recommendations in different ways. Having multiple words to state the same thing also helps if someone is having difficulty with one particular explanation.

Fifth slide: Call to action --
Sometimes the call to action can be combined with the recommendations slide. If there are multiple actions or activities recommended, a separate slide is best. 

Recall our example of a purpose statement: _Service center consolidation is an important cost savings initiative. The aim of this project was to determine the impact of service center consolidation on customer response times._ 
Suppose the data analysis showed that service center consolidation negatively impacted customer response times. A call to action might be to examine if processes need to change to bring customer response times back to what they were before the consolidation.

Wrapping it up: Getting feedback -- 
After you present to your audience, think about how you told your data story and how you can get feedback for improvement. Consider asking your manager or another data analyst for candid thoughts about your storytelling and presentation overall. Feedback is great to help you improve. When you have to write a brand new data story (or a sequel to the one you already told), you will be ready to impress your audience even more!
