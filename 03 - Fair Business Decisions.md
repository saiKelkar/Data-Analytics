Best practices:
- Consider all of the available data:
   - determine what data is going to be useful for your analysis
   - there will be (extra) data which might not be related, but it's critical to consider - so that your analysis reflects the truth and not just your expectations. 
- Identify surrounding factors:
  - context is the key for you and your stakeholders to understand the final conclusions of any analysis
  - consider surrounding factors that could influence the insights you're gaining
- Self-reported data:
  - participants provide information about themselves
  - this method can help avoid observer biases
  - provides important context to your conclusions
- Oversampling:
  - sometimes can help represent groups that otherwise wouldn't be represented fairly
  - it is a process of increasing the sample size of nondominant groups in a population
- Thinking about fairness from beginning to end:
  - consider fairness from the earliest stages of the project to when you act on the data insights
  - data collection, cleaning, processing, and analysis are all performed with fairness in mind
