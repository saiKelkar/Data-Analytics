Common problem types:
- Making predictions ( using data to make an informed decision about how things may be in the future )
- Categorizing things ( assigning information to different groups or clusters based on common features )
- Spotting something unusual ( identifying data that is different from the norm )
- Identifying themes ( grouping categorized information into broader concepts )
- Discovering connections ( finding similar challenges faced by different entities and combining data and insights to address them )
- Finding patterns ( using historical data to understand what happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again )
