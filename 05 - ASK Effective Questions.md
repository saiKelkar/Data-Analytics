Common problem types:
- Making predictions ( using data to make an informed decision about how things may be in the future )
- Categorizing things ( assigning information to different groups or clusters based on common features )
- Spotting something unusual ( identifying data that is different from the norm )
- Identifying themes ( grouping categorized information into broader concepts )
- Discovering connections ( finding similar challenges faced by different entities and combining data and insights to address them )
- Finding patterns ( using historical data to understand what happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again )

Effective questions - follow SMART methodology:
- Specific ( questions that are simple, significant, and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas )
- Measurable ( questions that can be quantified and assessed )
- Action-oriented ( questions that encourage change )
- Relevant ( questions that matter, are important, and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve )
- Time-bound ( questions that specify the time to be studied )

Data-inspired decision-making: explores different data sources to find out what they have in common

Quantitative data: specific and objective measures of numerical facts
( the what, how many, how often )
Qualitative data: subjective and explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics
( why )

Data representation tools: 
- Reports ( static collection of data given to stakeholders periodically )
- Dashboards ( monitor live, incoming data )

Pivot table: data summarization tool that is used in data processing ( pivot tables are used to summarize, sort, reorganize, group, count, total or average data stored in a database )

Metric: single, quantifiable type of data that can be used for measurement
Metric goal: measurable goal set by a company and evaluated using metrics

Small data ( specific / short time-period )
Big data ( large and less specific / long time-period )
