Six stages to a data life cycle:
- Plan ( decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who is responsible for it )
- Capture ( collect or bring in data from a variety of different sources )
- Manage ( care for and maintain the data )
- Analyze ( use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals )
- Archive ( keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference )
- Destroy ( remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data )

Data Analyst tools:
- Spreadsheets ( Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets )
- Query languages for databases ( SQL )
- Visualization tools ( Tableau / Looker / Power BI )
