Select the right data:
- How the data will be collected ( data that you collect yourself is called first-part data )
- Data sources ( Second-party data is collected directly by another group and then sold, Third-party data is sold by a provider that didn't collect the data themselves )

Discrete data - that is counted and has a limited number of values.
Continuous data - that is measured and can have almost any numeric value.

Nominal data - a type of qualitative data that is categorized without a set order.
Ordinal data - a type of qualitative data with a set order or scale.

Rows ( also called as Records )
Columns ( also called as Fields )

Wide data - data in which every data subject has a single row with multiple columns to hold the values of various attributes of the subject.
Long data - data in which each row is one time point per subject, so each subject will have data in multiple rows. 

Bias - a preference in favor of or against a person, group of people, or thing.
Data bias - a type of error that systematically skews results in a certain direction.
Unbiased sampling - when a sample is representative of the population being measured.

More types of data bias:
- Sampling bias (when a sample isn't representative of the population being measured)
- Observer bias / experimenter bias / research bias (the tendency for different people to observe things differently)
- Interpretation bias (the tendency to always interpret ambiguous situations in a positive or negative way)
- Confirmation bias (the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms pre-existing beliefs)

Identify good data sources:
- Reliable
- Original
- Comprehensive
- Current
- Cited

Data ethics - well-founded standards of right and wrong that dictate how data is collected, shared, and used.

Aspects of data ethics:
- Ownership (individuals own the raw data they provide and they have primary control over its usage, how it's processed, and how it's shared)
- Transaction transparency (all data-processing activities and algorithms should be completely explainable and understood by the individual who provides their data)
- Consent (an individual's right to know explicit details about how and why their data will be used before agreeing to provide it)
- Currency (individuals should be aware of financial transactions resulting from the use of their personal data and the scale of these transactions)
- Privacy (preserving a data subject's information and activity any time a data transaction occurs)
- Openness (free access, usage, and sharing of data)

Data interoperability - the ability of data systems and services to openly connect and share data.

Metadata - data about data

Relational database - a database that contains a series of related tables that can be connected via their relationships.
Normalization - process of organizing data in a relational database (for e.g., creating tables and establishing relationships between those tables)
Primary key 
- used to ensure data in a specific column is unique
- uniquely identifies a record in a relational database table
- only one primary key is allowed in a table
- cannot contain null or blank values
Foreign key 
- a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between the data in two tables 
- refers to the field in a table that's the primary key of another table
- more than one foreign key is allowed to exist in a table
